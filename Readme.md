üìå However, in general, a "todo" application typically refers to a task management system where users can create, update, and manage their tasks or to-do lists. It allows users to add tasks, set due dates, mark tasks as completed, and potentially categorize or prioritize tasks.

üîß If you are looking to build a todo application using Django Rest Framework, you can start by defining your models for tasks, such as a `Task` model with fields like title, description, due date, and completion status. Then, you can create Django Rest Framework serializers and views to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.

üîê To add JWT authentication to your API, you can follow the steps mentioned in the previous response.

üöÄ Once your API is set up with authentication, you can integrate it with a frontend application or use tools like cURL or Postman to interact with the API endpoints directly and perform tasks such as creating tasks, retrieving task details, updating tasks, and marking tasks as complete.
